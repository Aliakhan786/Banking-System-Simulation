# 🏦 Banking System Simulation (C++ Internship Project Task 2)

## 📌 Task Overview
This is Task 2 of the **C++ Programming Internship**. It is a console-based simulation of a simple banking system developed using **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts in C++.

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate basic banking operations like:
- Account creation
- Deposit
- Withdrawal
- Balance check
- Transaction history (Bonus)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
